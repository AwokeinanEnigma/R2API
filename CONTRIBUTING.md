# Contributing

So you want to contribute to R2API? Great! We invite all to contribute to R2API to make modding
easier for mod developers. Here are a few guidelines in order to make your contribution as easy as possible!

## Goals
The purpose of R2API is to provide an abstraction layer around RoR2's internal API in order to expose 
useful APIs that allow developers to more easily modify RoR2 without having to go to great depths and also allow 
mod interopability where not feasible elsewise (adding survivors, altering loot tables, etc). What this does not mean 
however is that R2API should alter the default functionality of RoR2. Without any mods installed a user should 
not even notice that R2API is installed. This is because R2API is just that, an API and not a mod in and of itself.

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are welcomed but may be rejected for the reasons mentioned above. Please maintain high code quality and
use the .editorconfig that is included in the repo. Any PRs with poor code quality or that do not adhere to the
.editorconfig may be denied.
