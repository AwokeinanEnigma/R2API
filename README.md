# R2API â€“ a modding API for Risk of Rain 2
[![Build Status](https://raegous.visualstudio.com/Risk%20of%20Rain%202%20Modding/_apis/build/status/Risk%20of%20Rain%202%20Modding-.NET%20Desktop-CI?branchName=master)](https://raegous.visualstudio.com/Risk%20of%20Rain%202%20Modding/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

## Note to Mod Developers

Breaking Change for next RoR2 Content Update: R2API Submodules (ResourceAPI, SurvivorAPI, etc) will be only enabled by using the R2APISubmoduleDependency attribute somewhere in your mod. As of the next update (for new BepInEx) all submodules will be enabled by default.

Example usage: 
[R2APISubmoduleDependency("SurvivorAPI", "DifficultyAPI")]

## About

R2API is designed to provide an abstraction layer in order to expose and simplify APIs to allow developers to modify
Risk of Rain 2 more easily, while still keeping mod interoperability in mind.

At it's heart, R2API is meant to be base work, which is why it doesnt include any additional in game functionality,
be it for developing or for users in general. **This is by choice.** A game with just R2API should feel and behave the
same as an unmodded game, the `isModded` flag excluded.

## Installation

The latest stable version is *NO LONGER* included in the [BepInEx Pack](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/) on Thunderstore.
